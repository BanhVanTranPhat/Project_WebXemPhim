00:00.440 --> 00:03.919

00:02.520 --> 00:05.209

technical but these are called core

00:15.720 --> 00:20.439
memories each one came from a super

00:18.320 --> 00:23.160
important time in Riley's life like when

00:20.439 --> 00:28.599
she first scored a goal that was so

00:23.160 --> 00:28.599

00:40.119 --> 00:45.159
and each core memory Powers a different

00:42.359 --> 00:47.558
aspect of Riley's personality like

00:45.159 --> 00:47.558
