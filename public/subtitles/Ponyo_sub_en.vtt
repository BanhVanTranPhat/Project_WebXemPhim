00:00:02.626 --> 00:00:04.545
The candle's bigger too.

00:00:04.628 --> 00:00:05.921
We can fit.

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:07.464
This is cool.

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:08.842
Cool!

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:10.092
Grab that end.

00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:11.218
Okay.

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:14.847
Ready?

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.474

She's seaworthy!

00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:35.784
Awesome. No leaks!

00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:38.537
Now we fill the boiler.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.207
The water goes in here.

00:00:42.332 --> 00:00:44.460
It goes in the boiler.

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:13.573
It goes like a rocket!

00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:22.748
Everything's shipshape.

00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:23.791
Shipshape!

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:24.709
Yes, it is.

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:27.212
-Shipshape? -Shipshape!

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:31.549
Shipshape! Shipshape!
